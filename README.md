# 🧮 Scientific Calculator (Kalkulator)

This project is an implementation of a comprehensive **Scientific Calculator**, built using **Python**. The application is designed to not only handle basic arithmetic operations but also provide advanced functionality in the field of **Linear Algebra**, such as matrix and vector computations, and solving Systems of Linear Equations (SLE). It is also equipped with a history management feature and an interactive quiz mode for practice.

## Key Features ✨

This calculator application offers a strong set of features for computation and learning needs:

Feature Description
| **Matrix Operations** | Supports standard matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), and calculation of **Determinant**, **Inverse**, and **Transpose**. |
| **Vector Operations** | Provides functions for vector operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, **Dot Product**, and **Cross Product**. |
| **Systems of Linear Equations (SLE/SPL)** | Capable of solving systems of linear equations (e.g., 2x2, 3x3) by displaying the steps or the final solution. |
| **Calculation History** | Records and saves all performed operations and results, allowing users to review previous sessions. |
| **Interactive Quiz Mode** | A special feature to test and practice the user's mathematical skills, particularly in Linear Algebra topics. |
| **Console User Interface** | A lightweight and efficient text/console-based application, easy to run on various operating systems. |
